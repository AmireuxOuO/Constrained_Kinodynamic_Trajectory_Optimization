# Constrained Kinodynamic Trajectory Optimization

## Dependencies
- **CasADi**: https://github.com/casadi/casadi
- **Pinocchio3**:  https://github.com/nmansard/jnrh2023

## Demo
The repository includes demo implementations for the following robotic systems:

- **UR10**: Simple unconstrained system.
- **Four-bar Parallel Robot**: System with holonomic constraints.

### TODO
- [ ] Systems with non-holonomic constriants.
- [ ] Differentiable collision detection.
